# Python-Challenge

This repo contains my submission for the Python Challenge. 

The folder PyBank contains an analysis of budget data, including an easy-to-read text file output.
The folder PyPoll contains code to analyze election data, including tallying candidate vote counts and percentages and outputting a winner.
